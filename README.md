Python
======
* Random projects of mine in Python 2.7 (http://python.org/). Many are completed school assignments from Grade 10 Computer Studies and Grade 11 Computer Science.

* Using Geany IDE (http://www.geany.org/).

* Some may use the Pygame library (http://www.pygame.org/), which I'm using for graphics projects for school.

* Stuff in this repository is an interesting snapshot of my learning progress in programming from late 2012 to early 2014. I was in the process of attempting to adhear to general guidelines to writing neat, readble code. One can notice some of these programs have many comments and some have none, some are somewhat spaced and some aren't at all. In the zelda game, it is also obvious that I was not versed in the concept of classes, resulting in a .py file running 916 lines long with code that I somehow got to work. I'm a teenager who writes code when he's bored and comes back to criticize it, what more is there to say?
