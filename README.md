Python
======
* Random projects of mine in Python 2.7.x, here (http://python.org/).

* Using Geany text-editor (http://www.geany.org/).

* Some may use the Pygame library (http://www.pygame.org/), which I'm using for graphics projects for school.

* I'm a weird teenager who writes code when he's bored, what more is there to say?
