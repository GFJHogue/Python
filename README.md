Python
======
* Random projects of mine in Python 2.7 (http://python.org/). Many are completed school assignments from Grade 10 Computer Studies and Grade 11 Computer Science.

* Using Geany IDE (http://www.geany.org/).

* Some may use the Pygame library (http://www.pygame.org/), which I'm using for graphics projects for school.

* I'm a teenager who writes code when he's bored, what more is there to say?
